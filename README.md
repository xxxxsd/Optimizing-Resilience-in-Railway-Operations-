# Optimizing-Resilience-in-Railway-Operations
This project is aimed at optimizing the resilience in railway operations
by predicting the incident reason for a particular delay taking into consideration 
various features. 
The data set we have worked on contains train delay information of the British 
railroad company Network Rail. It
contains feature columns about the delay, the routes and the reason for the
incident. We apply steps like data cleaning and preparation to our data set
and also added more feature columns (geographic coordinates) to analyze
our data and draw meaningful conclusions. We analyze the temporal and
spatial concerns of the data set as well as the incidents reasons. For our
use case, we construct a model to predict the incident reason category.
This is useful when the incident reason for a particular case is not known.
We build a random forest classifier on the prepared data set and obtained
an accuracy of 73.95%. We create an application for the management to
predict the incident category. Then we analyse the reasons for the delay,
systematize them and formulate suitable recommendations.
